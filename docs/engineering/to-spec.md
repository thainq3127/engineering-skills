## What it does

`to-spec` turns the current conversation and your codebase understanding into a spec (you may know this document as a PRD), then publishes it to your issue tracker.

It does **not** interview you again. By the time you reach for it, the alignment work is done — `to-spec` synthesises what is already known rather than asking a fresh round of questions. It does pause once for you to confirm the proposed delivery context and testing seams before publishing.

## When to reach for it

You invoke this by typing `/to-spec` — the agent won't reach for it on its own.

Reach for it once a change has been talked through and the domain language is settled, and you want that shared understanding written down before any code is written. If you *haven't* aligned yet, grill first — for that, use [grill-with-docs](https://aihero.dev/skills-grill-with-docs). To split the finished spec into tickets, use [to-tickets](https://aihero.dev/skills-to-tickets).

## Prerequisites

`to-spec` publishes into your issue tracker, so [setup-matt-pocock-skills](https://aihero.dev/skills-setup-matt-pocock-skills) must have configured the tracker and triage labels for this repo first. It applies the `ready-for-agent` label itself — no separate triage pass needed.

## What the spec includes

- **Problem statement** — what is broken or missing, and why it's worth solving, in the project's own vocabulary.
- **Solution** — the shape of the fix at a high level, before any implementation detail.
- **Delivery context** — the product stage, current objective, critical journeys, release gate, operating envelope, and explicit non-goals that later reviews use to separate technical severity from delivery priority.
- **User stories** — an extensive, numbered list of the concrete behaviours the change must support, each one independently checkable.
- **Implementation decisions** — the choices already settled during the conversation, so they aren't relitigated later.
- **Testing decisions** — the seams the feature will be tested at, and what "done" looks like.
- **Out-of-scope items** — what this change deliberately does *not* cover, to keep the ticket bounded.
- **Further notes** — anything else worth carrying forward that doesn't fit the sections above.

## Deep modules

Before writing the spec, `to-spec` sketches the **seams** at which the feature will be tested and looks for **deep module** opportunities — a lot of functionality hidden behind a small, stable interface. It prefers existing seams to new ones and the highest seam possible, ideally just one across the whole change.

That matters for agentic development: a good interface gives tests something durable to target, so the code underneath can change without the tests moving.

## It's working if

- It starts writing the spec instead of asking you a fresh round of questions.
- It presents one confirmation packet containing the delivery context and testing seams before publishing.
- It records the confirmed delivery boundary in the spec rather than static project instructions.
- The spec comes back in your project's domain vocabulary, not generic boilerplate.

## Workstream protocol

When Workstreams are enabled, `to-spec` resolves or creates the durable Workstream before publishing. The Workstream root remains a low-resolution index; the specification is a separate child Issue labelled `kind:spec` and `ws:<slug>`, registered in the Project while active. Its confirmed Delivery Context becomes the source of truth that Review Composer freezes later. Publishing ends with a durable handoff to ticketing rather than a chat-local TODO.

## Where it fits

`to-spec` is a step in the main build chain:

```txt
grill-with-docs → to-spec → to-tickets → implement → code-review
```

Reach for it after the plan and domain language are resolved, and before you break the work into implementation tickets. Its key neighbours are [grill-with-docs](https://aihero.dev/skills-grill-with-docs), which sharpens the context so the spec is precise, and [to-tickets](https://aihero.dev/skills-to-tickets), which turns the spec into a set of tickets for [implement](https://aihero.dev/skills-implement) to build. When you're unsure which skill or flow fits, [ask-matt](https://aihero.dev/skills-ask-matt) routes you.
